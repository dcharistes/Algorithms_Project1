# Algorithms Project 1

## Overview

This project contains implementations and experiments related to fundamental algorithms.  
It is developed as part of an academic coursework or personal study on algorithm design and analysis.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Sorting Algorithm Implementation
Implement and analyze a fundamental sorting algorithm (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).  
The task focuses on understanding algorithmic complexity, recursion, and performance evaluation on different datasets.

### Task 2: Graph Algorithm - Shortest Path
Develop an algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph (e.g., Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford algorithm).  
This task emphasizes graph representations, priority queues, and efficient traversal strategies.

### Task 3: Dynamic Programming Problem
Solve a classic dynamic programming problem (e.g., Longest Common Subsequence or Knapsack Problem).  
The objective is to practice problem decomposition, memoization, and optimization techniques.
