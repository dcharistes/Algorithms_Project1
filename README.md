# Algorithms Project 1

## Overview

This project contains implementations and experiments related to fundamental algorithms.  
It is developed as part of an academic coursework or personal study on algorithm design and analysis.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Arithmetic Sequence Calculation
Implements two methods to compute the n-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
- A recursive approach.
- A non-recursive (iterative) approach. 
The user inputs the first term, common difference, and the term position.

### Task 2: Sum of Prime Numbers
Calculates the sum of all prime numbers up to a given number n:
- Using a recursive method.
- Using a non-recursive method. 
The code also includes a function to check whether a number is prime, optimized by checking divisibility up to âˆšn.

### Task 3: Minimum Distance Between Array Elements
Finds the minimum distance between any two elements in a randomly generated array:
- Provides a basic method and an optimized method for finding the minimum distance.
- Measures and logs the execution time for both methods into a CSV file for performance comparison.
